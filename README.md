# HTW-Pixel-Controllers

I originally wanted to create these controllers for Honor The Warriors so that every HTW participant in any parade or night ride could have a high quality set of LED lights.  Then on February 5th I found out about Terry Sague being hit and killed by a car and another cyclist that was in the group being hospitalized which was yet another reason to get these done sooner than later.
Basic Use (No app, just plug in and use):
1.	Plug USB cord into trike battery or USB Powerbank.
2.	Press the power switch on the side of the USB Powerbank.
3.	Turn it on via toggle switch. (It will default to 4th of July / Red, White, and Blue)
4.	Select a preset by pressing preset button – I programmed 5 presets into them:
a.	4th of July – Red, White, & Blue – (Default when the controller is turned on)
b.	Christmas – Red & Green
c.	Multicolor – Multicolor cycle
d.	Night Ride – Red, White, & Orange
e.	Maintenance – All White – Use for fixing something on your trike in the dark.

Advanced Use (:
Download app to your phone:
	iPhone: = WLED Native = https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wled-native/id6446207239 
	Android = WLED = https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aircoookie.WLED 

Open the app and make it scan for new instances of WLED – You should see an instance with the ID that is on the white label on your controller’s cable.
Pick any colors / Effects that you want!
Notes:
1.	If you use the app and want to save a custom pattern to your controllers preset list, Please leave the first 5 presets as is so they are the same on everyone’s controllers.  I have Jerry’s controller set up to be able to sync up to all other controllers and keep everyone in sync, as well as a remote that will do the same.  If you change any of the first 5 presets, that will mess things up.
2.	Please don’t upgrade the firmware or change anything else in the settings – The firmware version these have is stable and they are all identical – I’d like to keep it that way.
3.	Unfortunately, the power switches I got from China are not as moisture proof as I thought and can get oxidation on the contacts.  If after doing steps 1-3 above the controller does not turn on, rapidly turn the power switch on and off about 10-20 times to clean the contacts.  (I added 2 silica gel packs to the 3D printed cases and used form-a-gasket to seal the lids on, so hopefully this won’t be an issue.)
4.	The white USB-A to USB-C cable in the accessory bag is to charge the USB Powerbanks.  The USB-C connectors on the USB Powerbanks are VERY delicate – PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL INSERTING AND REMOVING THOSE CABLES.
