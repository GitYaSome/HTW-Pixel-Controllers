I originally wanted to create these controllers as a gift for my fellow Warriors so that every HTW participant in any parade or night ride could have a high-quality set of LED lights.  On February 5th, 2024 I found out about Terry Sague being hit and killed by a car.  Other cyclists he was with were hospitalized.  That was yet another reason to get these done sooner rather than later.


Basic Use:
1.	Plug USB cord into trike battery or USB Powerbank.
2.	Press the power switch on the side of the USB Powerbank.
3.	Turn on the controller via the toggle switch. (It will default to 4th of July / Red, White, and Blue)
4.	Select a preset by pressing preset button – I programmed 5 presets into them:

 a.	4th of July – Red, White, & Blue – (Default when the controller is turned on)
 b.	Christmas – Red & Green
 c.	Multicolor – Multicolor cycle – Alternate for Christmas
 d.	Night Ride – Red, White, & Orange
 e.	Maintenance – All White – Use for fixing something on your trike in the dark.


Notes:
1.	Unfortunately, the power switches I got from China are not as moisture proof as I thought and can get oxidation on the contacts.  If after doing steps 1-3 above the controller does not turn on, rapidly turn the power switch on and off about 10-20 times to clean the contacts.  (I added 2 silica gel packs to the 3D printed cases and used form-a-gasket to seal the lids on, so hopefully this won’t be an issue.)
2.	The white USB-A to USB-C cable in the accessory bag is to charge the USB Powerbanks.  The USB-C connectors on the USB Powerbanks are VERY delicate – PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL INSERTING AND REMOVING THOSE CABLES.
In case anyone ever needs to make more or needs to troubleshoot, etc..

 
1.	3D Printed Case design files
2.	Circuit board schematics, Pick&Place, Gerber Files, & BOM
3.	Parts lists
4.	Extra Pictures


I hope you enjoy using these as much as I enjoyed making them for you – Have fun!!!
