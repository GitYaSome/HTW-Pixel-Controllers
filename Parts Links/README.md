50 Strand Bullet Pixels:
No mater where you buy them or what spacing you use, make sure you get WS281x, 5VDC, xConnect pinout (Many different pinouts are out there and if you put voltage into the data line, at a minimum you will kill the first pixel and have to cut it out and splice the cuts.) I ordered 2 strands of 50 for each controller with 6 inch spacing.
