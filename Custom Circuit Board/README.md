There are 3 files in this directory:
  1. BOM_HTW WLED PCB_2023-12-21.csv - This is the Bill of Materials file that contains part numbers for the assembly service to know what parts are needed.
  2. Gerber_HTW WLED PCB.zip - This is the file that has the board dimensions, locations of holes to be drilled, and schematic diagram. 
  3. PickAndPlace_HTW WLED PCB_2023-12-21.csv - This is the file that tells the assembly service the X and Y coordinates of where to place parts.

Those 3 files are what you would send to a Printed Circuit Board manufacturer (I use JLCPCB) to have PCB's made.
In addition to those 3 files, here are some pictures:
