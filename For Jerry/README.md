The controllers can all work in multiple ways:

1. 100% Stand Alone - Everyone responsible for their own.
   Each person will turn their controller on and select a preset.

2. Jerry Controls everyone via handheld remote.
   If there are about 12 controllers or less (We can test this in real world conditions once handed out) you can use the Wiz remote to turn everyone on / off and select 1 of the first 4 presets.
   Note - This is a software on / off - They will still all have to have their power swithches set to On at their individual controllers.

3. More than 12 riders via the Wiz remote or if you want to use the WLED App.
   Pack the included Wi-Fi router with you, and turn it on.  Then have each rider turn their controller on - They will all connect to this router and your controller is set to be the master controller - Whatever you do on yours, theirs will sync to it.
   Note - Your controller is HTW01 and has a special yellow heat shrink on the data cable to help differentiate it from the others.

4. If you are ever asked fo any password on the router or in the WLED app, the password is Warr10r5!
